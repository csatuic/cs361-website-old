# Lab 2: Turning in assignments

This lab is a test run for turning in the homeworks for this class, and
a test run for doing the paired lab activities for this class.
There are two main deliverables:

  1. For the first half hour of the lab, we'll be helping people in the Blackboard Collaborate main
     room to make sure your SSH keys
     are working and added to your GitHub account. You can test that everything is working by
     submitting the lab's Gradescope assignment: Go to the [this GitHub Classroom
     assignment]({{page.github_link}}) and accept the invite. The task
     is a super simple "write a program that returns 42" like in the
     video demo. For evaluation, you need to complete the process of
     working on your code and then turning it in via Gradescope, and
     demonstrate how you did that to your peer. All course assignments
     are visible from the [course Gradescope page]({{site.gradescope}}).
     Passing the gradescope assignment will be two points toward your
     lab grade for this week.
  
  2. If you have had any issues getting your programming environment set
     up, now is the time to get some help on that, either from the TA in
     lab or the other students. Once you feel you're ready to
     demonstrate that you can turn in an assignment, find your breakout
     room on [this sheet]({{page.pairings}}). Each tab on the sheet
     lists the breakout room number, the UIC email of the grader and the
     person-being-graded for the respective lab sessions. In your break
     out room, screen share with your evaluator and show them that you
     are able to execute the homework submission workflow. The grader
     will give you one point for each of:
      * Can clone a clean copy of your assignment GitHub repository using
     ssh without typing a password (this means the repository link
     will be of the format
     `git@github.com:ckanich-classrooms/week-2-lab-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git`)
     * Can make a change, commit it, and push it (again no password
     typing).
     * Can navigate to the course Gradescope page and upload those
       changes (this upload goes through GitHub, not the machine where
       you were doing your programming).
3. When you are the grader, it's your responsibility to watch the other
   student perform the steps in #2. If they get stuck on a specific
   thing, you can give them hints, help them out a bit, but not do it
   for them/straight up tell them the answer. Once they finish you must
   record their score via [this form]({{ page.eval_link }}). Performing
   your assigned grading will earn you two points toward the lab.


## Peer evaluation rubric

Peer evaluation for this lab is out of 3 points total. Here is how to
assign points during peer evaluation:


|task | points |
|---|---|
| Clone your lab2 repo | 1 point |
| commit and push a change | 1 points |
| Submit the new version via Gradescope | 1 points |
| Total points | 3 points |
{: class="table table-striped"}

## Total grade calculation



|task | points |
|---|---|
|Turn in a Gradescope assignment that passes the tests | 2 points |
| Demonstrate that you can clone, edit, push, and submit |3 points |
| Evaluate another student | 2 points |
| Total points | 7 points |
{: class="table table-striped"}

## Timing 

There will be an "A" and a "B" evaluation: A runs
from :30-:40 past the hour of your lab session, and B runs from :40-:50.

If your grader isn't in lab, contact the TA and they
will either pair you up with someone else or evaluate you. If the person you are in charge of
grading isn't in the lab, you can evaluate a TA.
