# Lab 3: Exam prep

This is a paired lab activity meant to prepare you for technical interviews and the concepts covered
on the exam.


There is one deliverable: conducting the peer assessment as we did two weeks ago based on the
pairings listed on [this sheet]({{page.pairings}}). Each tab on the sheet lists the breakout room
number, the UIC email of the grader and the person-being-graded for the respective lab sessions.
Everyone that is evaluating in session 1 will have access to [this doc]({{page.session_1_rubric}}) that has the grading
rubric for question 1, and everyone that is evaluating in session 2 will have access to [this doc]({{page.session_2_rubric}})
that has the grading rubric for question 2.



## Peer evaluation rubric

The grading for this lab is just one point. The grading for this assignment is _lenient_ but it is
not purely "show up, get credit" - while these are complex questions with lots of answers, full
credit should be given for anyone that is able to meaningfully hit any one of the points in the
rubric.

| Session | Question | Points |
|---|---|---|
| Session 1 | Explain why dynamic linking makes libraries easier to update. | 1 point |
| Session 2 | Imagine a world without addends in relocation entries. What two features of relocation would no longer be possible and why? | 1 point |
{: class="table table-striped"}

## Total grade calculation



| task | points |
|---|---|
| As an evaluator, ask your session question and evaluate their explanation | 1 point |
| An an evaluatee, answer and give reasons for your answer to your session question | 1 point |
{: class="table table-striped"}

## Timing 

Please start Session 1 as soon as you get to lab; it will be over at :15 after the hour. Likewise,
Session 2 will be over at :30 after the hour. With the remainder of the class, you are free to go or
you can stick around for a group explanation by the TA at :30.


If your grader isn't in lab, contact the TA and they
will either pair you up with someone else or evaluate you. If the person you are in charge of
grading isn't in the lab, you can evaluate a TA.


You can **only** evaluate/be evaluated by the person who you are assigned, **or** someone that the
TA has designated. Anyone who submits an evaluation besides this will receive a zero for the lab.
