# Homework 0: Turning in assignments

This homework is a test run for turning in the homeworks for this class. 
You will be able to test that everything is working by submitting the 
Gradescope assignment, which will be the same process for the future assignments.
This assignment is a practice to make sure that each student is comfortable with:
   * Cloning a clean copy of your assignment GitHub repository using
   SSH without typing a password (this means the repository link
   will be of the format
   `git@github.com:ckanich-classrooms/cs361-hw0-YOURGITHUBUSERNAME.git`)
   * Making a change, committing it, and pushing it (again no password typing).
   * Navigating to the course Gradescope page and uploading those
      changes (this upload goes through GitHub, not the machine where
      you were doing your programming).

Before accepting this assignment, make sure your SSH keys
are working and added to your GitHub account. Go to the [this GitHub Classroom
assignment]({{page.github_link}}) and accept the invite. The task
is a super simple **"write a program that returns 42"**. 
For evaluation, you need to complete the process of
working on your code and then turning it in via Gradescope. 
All course assignments are visible from the [course Gradescope page]({{site.gradescope}}).

If you have had any issues getting your programming environment set
up, now is the time to get some help on that, either from the TAs during the office hours
or posting on [Piazza]({{site.discussion}}). 

## Grading
Grading will be done automatically using Gradescope. Committing to
GitHub is not sufficient - your code must be submitted to Gradescope. If
you have issues with the autograder, please contact us via Piazza ASAP.
**Please keep in mind that technical issues with submitting your assignment is not an acceptable
excuse for submitting the assignments improperly or late.**

## Points
This assignment has **0 points**. The autograder points are shown for demonstration.

## Due Date
This assignment is due {{ page.due.date | date_to_rfc822 }}. See the
[syllabus](syllabus.html) for the late turnin policy.
